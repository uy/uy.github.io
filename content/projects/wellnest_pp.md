# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the **WellNest – AI Health Companion** app (hereby referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices, developed by Utku Yeğen (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".

---

## 1. Overview

WellNest is designed with a privacy-first architecture.

By default, all user data is processed locally on the user's device using an on-device large language model (Local LLM).

Users may optionally enable Enhanced AI Insights, which uses OpenAI’s API for advanced analysis. External processing requires explicit user consent.

---

## 2. What Information Does the Application Obtain?

The Application allows users to create and store:

- Journal entries  
- Mood logs  
- Wellness reflections  
- Optional Apple Health data (if the user grants HealthKit permission)

Registration is not required to use the Application.

All data is stored locally on the device unless the user explicitly enables Enhanced AI Insights.

---

## 3. Local AI Processing (Default Mode)

By default:

- AI insights are generated using an on-device language model.
- No journal entries, mood logs, or health data are transmitted externally.
- No personal data leaves the user's device.

If the user does not enable Enhanced AI Insights, all processing remains fully local.

---

## 4. Optional Enhanced AI Insights (Paid Feature)

Users may choose to enable Enhanced AI Insights as part of a paid subscription.

If the user explicitly consents:

- Selected user data (such as journal entries, mood logs, reflections, and optionally authorized health metrics) may be securely transmitted to **OpenAI** via its API for advanced AI analysis.
- Data is transmitted only when the user requests enhanced AI-generated insights.
- Data is encrypted in transit.
- Data is used solely to generate the requested AI response.
- Data is not sold.
- Data is not used for advertising purposes.

OpenAI processes data in accordance with its privacy and security standards. The Application does not allow OpenAI to use user data for marketing purposes.

Before any data is transmitted externally, the Application presents a clear consent screen explaining:

- What data will be shared  
- Why it will be shared  
- That it will be processed by OpenAI  
- That consent can be withdrawn at any time  

Users can disable Enhanced AI Insights at any time in the Application settings.

If the user does not enable this feature, no personal data is transmitted to OpenAI.

---

## 5. Third-Party Access to Information

Third parties only receive user data if:

1. The user explicitly enables Enhanced AI Insights, and  
2. The user requests AI-generated analysis.

In such cases, data is shared solely with OpenAI for the purpose of generating AI-powered insights.

Otherwise, no user data is shared with third parties.

---

## 6. Health Data

If the user grants Apple Health (HealthKit) permissions:

- Health data remains stored on-device.
- Health data is never transmitted externally unless the user explicitly enables Enhanced AI Insights and requests AI analysis involving health metrics.

Users can revoke HealthKit permissions at any time via iOS Settings.

---

## 7. Location Data

The Application does not collect precise real-time location information.

---

## 8. Data Retention

- Local data remains stored on the user's device.
- Data transmitted to OpenAI for Enhanced AI processing is retained only as necessary to generate the requested response.
- Users may delete their journal entries and wellness data at any time.
- Uninstalling the Application removes locally stored data.

---

## 9. User Rights and Opt-Out

Users may:

- Use the Application entirely in local-only mode.
- Decline to enable Enhanced AI Insights.
- Withdraw consent at any time in settings.
- Delete stored data.
- Uninstall the Application.

---

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Application is not intended for children under 13 years of age.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact:

utkuyegen@gmail.com

Users must be at least 16 years of age (or the applicable age of consent in their country) to enable Enhanced AI Insights.

---

## 11. Security

The Service Provider implements reasonable safeguards, including:

- Local-first data processing
- Encrypted API communication with OpenAI
- Purpose-limited data transmission
- No advertising-based data usage
- No data selling practices

---

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Updates will be reflected by revising the effective date below.

Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any updates.

Effective Date: 2026-02-23
